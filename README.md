2D-FPGA Paper. Github basics for the uninitiated:

1) You can download the code from this repository. The complete set of files is necessary to typeset the document. 
2) The master branch is the ``official'' document. To edit and commit within the repository, create a new branch and make sure it's easy to figure out what the branch is for (editing intro, etc.).
3) After editing, create a pull request, and I will pull the branch into the repository.

4) Downloading the PDF and emailing changes to me works too, if this is prohibitively complicated.
